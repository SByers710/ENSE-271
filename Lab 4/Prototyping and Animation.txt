Lab 4: Prototyping and Animation
  In this lab the aim was to create a working prototype in Figma with functions like being able be directed to pages using the menu and selecting the next photo in a slideshow. We were provided a template which we had to customize to promote a desination of our choice regardless on whether it was real or fictional. I almost chose a fictional world from literature but I realized that it would be difficult to obtain enough photos and decided to instead model Moose Jaw the city I grew up in due to it's familarity and rich history.
